This folder contains some example Appy applications used for testing purposes.

Directly in the folder, you have the application "AppyMeeting" which consists in
a single Python file (module AppyMeeting.py) and a POD template for producing
documents (Meeting.odt). You also have simple applications Zzz.py and
ZopeComponent.py that are one-file applications.

In sub-folder AppyCar, you have a more complex application that is structured
as a Python package (a hierarchy of folders).
