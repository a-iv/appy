    <p>Appy (<b>Ap</b>plications in <b>py</b>thon) is a bunch of tools distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL license</a> for developing applications in the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> programming language. The framework features two main modules: <a href="gen.html"><b>gen</b></a> and <a href="pod.html"><b>pod</b></a>.</p>

    <h1>Developers, too, have the right to (h)appyness !</h1>

    <p>Developers are often guys that live on another planet. Some think this is because software development is so exciting that everything else is poorly considered. At Null-IT software, we are deeply convinced that most developers do not enjoy themselves. They spend their lives together with complex problems that never go away from their minds. Nobody understands them. Their family? Their managers? Their clients? Their friends? No. Nobody. Nobody is able to imagine how huge and complex their tasks are. Consequently, what they do is underestimated. Worst: they can't communicate. Don't believe this is due to some intrinseque geek attitude. Their geekness results from the global incapacity to apprehend the very nature of their abilities. So they are forced to work harder while experiencing the true impossibility to share their permanent software experience. Of course, it may lead to social disasters.</p>

    <p>By publishing this high-level, easy-to-use software construction kit, itself based on the tremendously productivity-boosting Python programming language, our crazy hope is to empower developers in such a way that they can leave more often their software prison and spend more time to discover real life.</p>

    <p>But (h)appyness has a price. Appy developers themselves accepted to pay. They have dealed their social life for one of the highest forms of social denial (sorry we can't reveal their working conditions), hoping their sacrifice will free the users of their work. So if one day you meet one of them, please be gentle and patient. But they will probably not discuss with you.</p>

    <h1>The null-IT principle</h1>

    <p>Our action is guided by the following principle:</p>

    <h2>Information Technology (IT) should be as transparent and invisible as possible.</h2>

    <p>While this may seem obvious, this principle is largely ridiculed by a great number of widespread technologies. I will mention here JEE and XSL-FO which were taken as counter-examples while developing <a href="pod.html">pod</a>. In the Python world, Zope 3, by trying to mimick the ridiculous JEE component-model where code is viciously chopped into undersized chunks interconnected by obscure XML declarations, falls unfortunately into this category as well. This is a pity seeing Zope guys trying to abandon the elegant, simple, powerful (in a word: Pythonic) design of Zope 2. But don't be scared! Many people think that Zope 2 will last for many years... Null-IT, with others, is working hard to fight against the generalized Balkanization attitude that undermine IT innovation. If you believe there is still place for hope, you came at the right site. It is time to discover <a href="gen.html">gen!</a></p>

    <p>The Appy framework needs Python 2.4 or higher.</p>
