'''job.py must be executed by a "zopectl run" command and, as single arg,
   must get a string with the following format:

    <ZopeAdmin>:<PloneInstancePath>:<ApplicationName>:<ToolMethodName>[:<args>].

     <ZopeAdmin> is the userName of the Zope administrator for this instance.
     <PloneInstancePath> is the path, within Zope, to the Plone Site object (if
                         not at the root of the Zope hierarchy, use '/' as
                         folder separator); leave blank if using appy.gen > 0.8

     <ApplicationName> is the name of the Appy application. If it begins with
                       "path=", it does not represent an Appy application, but
                       the path, within <PloneInstancePath>, to any Zope object
                       (use '/' as folder separator); leave blank if using
                       appy.gen > 0.8;

     <ToolMethodName> is the name of the method to call on the tool in this
                      Appy application, or the method to call on the arbitrary
                      Zope object if previous param starts with "path=".

     <args> (optional) are the arguments to give to this method (only strings
            are supported). Several arguments must be separated by '*'.

    Note that you can also specify several commands, separated with
    semicolons (";"). This scripts performs a single commit after all commands
    have been executed.
